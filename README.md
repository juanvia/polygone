## Install

You can install all the needed dependencies by running `yarn`.

I promise you a very nice README.md soon. Stay tuned.

### ToDo

- Convert all variable names from camelCase to underscore_separated
- Refactor recursive call in reducer
- Async web service call. Use  https://quotes.rest/ to retrieve quotes and put them in the sidebar.
- Try to enable OCaml syntax
- Go mobile & desktop via Cordova, platforms android and electron.
